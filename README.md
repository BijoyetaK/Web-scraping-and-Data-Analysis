# Web-scraping-and-Data-Analysis
Module 11 Assignment 
### This assignment involved :
   -  Identifying HTMLelements on a page 
   -  Identify their id and class attributes
   -  Use this knowledge to extract information via both automated browsing with Splinter and HTML parsing with Beautiful Soup. 

### 2 Deliverables - jupyter notebooks
   - Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.
   - Deliverable 2: Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.
      

### Deliverable 1: Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news webpage

   - Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news website and inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape to get the news
   - https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_news/index.html  
   - Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website. 
   - Test it out by selecting one news article with select_one() 
   - After analyzing the the text elements returned, attempting to exract all the text elements using find_all and class params.
   - Storing all the results:
      -  Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles from the subset of the soup element scraped above above. 
      -  Store the scraping results in Python data structures as follows:
      -  Store each title-and-preview pair in a Python dictionary,mars_articles_dict. And, give each dictionary two keys: title and preview.
      -  example: 
         -  {
               'title': "NASA's MAVEN Observes Martian Light Show Caused by Major Solar Storm", 
               'preview': "For the first time in its eight years orbiting Mars, NASAâ€™s MAVEN mission 
                witnessed two different types of ultraviolet aurorae simultaneously, the result of solar storms that began on Aug. 27."
            }
         
   - Store all the dictionaries in a Python list,mars_articles_list.
   - For loop is used to loop through the text elements:

   - Print the list in your notebook:

   -  Quit browser session
     

### Deliverable 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

   - Visit the Website : Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site. Inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
   - https://static.bc-edx.com/data/web/mars_facts/temperature.html
   - Inspect the page by using Chrome DevTools to discover whether the table contains usable classes.
         
   - Scrape the Table : Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table:

   - Extract all rows of data:

   - mars_table has header rows(<th></th>), and data rows(<td></td>) under <tr> and class data-row.
   
   - Store the Data: Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website. 
   - Explanation of column headings:

   - Looping through the scraped data to create a list of rows:

      row list looks like:

   - Create a Pandas DataFrame by using the list of rows and a list of the column names:

   - Prepare Data for Analysis: Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column. 
                                 Cast (or convert) the data to the appropriate datetime, int, or float data types.
             
   - Analysis questions: 
      -  How many months exist on Mars?
      -  How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?
      -  What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:
      -  Find the average the minimum daily temperature for all of the months.
      -  Plot the results as a bar chart.
      -  Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? 
            -  Find the average the daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.
            -  Plot the results as a bar chart.
            -  About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? 
               -  Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.
               -  Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
   
### How many months are there on Mars?

   - Plot the average temperature by month:

   - Identifying the colest and hottest months in Curiosity's location:

      -  From the plot, month 3 and 4 are the coldest and 8 & 9th are the warmest months. 
   
### Identify the lowest and highest atmospheric pressure on Mars: 
   -  Calculate average pressure by Martian month. 
   -  Plot the average pressure by month.

   - From the plot above, months 6 and 5 have the lowest atmospheric pressure. Month 2nd and 9th have the highest atmospheric pressure.   

### How many terrestrial (earth) days are there in a Martian year?
   
   -  Considered how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once. 
   -  Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature. 
   - Calculating the peak to peak distance in the scatter plot using scipy.

   - Analysis: 
      -  The outlier peaks or spikes are ignored calculation.There could be some other natural phenomenon which could lead to high temperature. 
         Considering the approx peak to peak distance,is roughly 1490-825, or 665 days. A year on Mars appears to be about 665 days from the plot. 
         Internet search confirms that a Mars year is equivalent to 687 earth days.
